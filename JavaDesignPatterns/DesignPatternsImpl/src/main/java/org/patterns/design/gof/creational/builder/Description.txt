Builder Pattern is one of the Creation patterns where it solves the problem of Complex Object Creations

It solves 2 Problems primarily for a class that is having
    - Many variables
    - Optional variables to initialize

As per the clean code design, the constructor shouldn't have more than 5 arguments

Say, if a class has 10 member variables, then, the following cases might occur
    - the class will end up creating 10 arg Constructor
    - Constructor overloading - in case if some of the variables are optional to initialize

Builder Pattern addresses the above issue
    - Create Clean Code for Object creation by abstracting the place for Object creation
    - Make room for having optional variables being set without Constructor Overloading

Rules:
    - Do not have public all arguments constructor
    - Have Private Setters
    -
