Abstract Factory is an extension to Factory Pattern

Say, we do manufacture a scooter that has 2 different models

Model A = Alloy Wheels and Blue Color
Model B = Steel Wheels and White Color

Now the abstraction is as follows

    Root Level Abstraction
        WheelFactory Interface ->
            - AlloyWheel Impl
            - SteelWheel Impl
        ColorFactory Interface ->
            - BlueColor Impl
            - WhiteColor Impl

    Top Level Abstraction
        ScooterFactory Interface ->
            - WheelFactory  -> getWheel(WheelType)
            - ColorFactory  -> getColor(ColorType)

Adding a new category required changes to the base as well as sub factory implementations

We provide the client code with the concrete factory so that it can create objects
