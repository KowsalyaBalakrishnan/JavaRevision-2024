Singleton Pattern - One Global Instance

Implementation:-
    - Class constructors must not be accessed globally to prevent object creation
    - Subclass or Inheritance is not allowed as it may permit object creation
    - Create a public static method

2 possible types of Singleton:-
    1. Early Initialization - Eager Singleton - Create Singleton as soon as the class is loaded
    2. Lazy Initialization - Lazy Singleton - Create Singleton when required for the first time called
