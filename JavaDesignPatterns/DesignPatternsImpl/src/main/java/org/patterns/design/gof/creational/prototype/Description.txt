Prototype is used to create multiple instances from a base object [Prototype].

This happens whenever we have a complex object that is costly to create multiple times.

To create more such instances of a class, we use an existing instance as our prototype.

It saves us from re-creating objects from scratch

The class will allow to create multiple instance with the help of Clone().
    - Thus, implement Cloneable interface and override clone() to return the copy of itself
    - Handle CloneNotSupportedException in throws clause as it helps future subclasses eligibility to clone
    - Consider if Deep or Shallow copy is required!
